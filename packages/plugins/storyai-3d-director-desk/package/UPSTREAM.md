# StoryAI 3D Director Desk vendoring

The static application in this directory is built from:

- repository: `https://github.com/jiguang132/storyai-3d-director-desk`
- upstream commit: `8c8bd361790be4d37158a7430365e65546e358fe`
- upstream package version: `0.0.1`
- source license: MIT, Copyright (c) 2026 YZ

This is not the private MiniMax Hub `3d-director-stage` plugin. Convax uses the
open-source project as an independent built-in Plugin and does not copy MiniMax
Hub assets or code.

The Convax build differs from upstream in eight deliberate ways:

1. it uses the existing `convax.plugin-host/1` MessageChannel instead of wildcard
   parent-window messages;
2. portable scene state and the director viewport camera are kept separate inside
   one owning Canvas-node snapshot, with schema-v1 migration, schema-v2 hydration,
   early host connection, bounded snapshots, gesture-end flush (including a final
   snapshot while an intermediate write is in flight), timeout/retry and fail-closed
   schema handling;
3. browser `localStorage` persistence and the upstream wildcard host-capture
   messages are disabled inside the opaque-origin sandbox;
4. the bundled Sketchfab Standard mannequin is omitted. The MIT-licensed
   procedural mannequin remains available, avoiding redistribution of a model that
   is not itself open source;
5. local model import and image-download controls are hidden until scoped host
   capabilities can support them without relaxing the Plugin CSP or iframe sandbox;
6. the MessageChannel handshake accepts only the parent host and this exact Plugin
   id before treating the transferred port as a scoped capability token.
7. session-only local media and camera captures remain usable, but surface a visible
   portability warning instead of silently pretending their browser URLs persist.
8. the Canvas-owned Play toolbar command captures exactly the current viewport,
   then requests one scoped, managed Canvas image connected from the owning Plugin
   node; concurrent clicks and invalid or stale host scope fail closed.

The complete static Plugin package lives under
`packages/plugins/storyai-3d-director-desk/package/` in the
`microvoid/convax-plugins` repository. The deterministic release ZIP is installed
through the ordinary Convax Registry lifecycle. Convax Desktop does not carry a
second static bundle or reserve this package as a built-in id. The iframe never
executes code from a development dependency or Node module.

The upstream-generated JavaScript is preserved byte-for-byte as `vendor/app.js`.
The trusted `scripts/build.ts` step replaces inert remote documentation literals,
splits XML namespace identifiers, and replaces the four bundled generic `fetch`
loaders with an explicit local rejection before publishing `package/assets/app.js`.
Do not hand-edit either generated file. The checked-in inputs and outputs are pinned
by these SHA-256 hashes:

- `vendor/app.js`: `a98fa137c6917ec77a1f957826cefcb70fccb749d8a46868cd4c2457d701eec4`
- `package/assets/app.js`: `262c9dbfa7fd4685181a79a8eb288ea76860e029e13f117e6a98a4353f21b540`
- `assets/styles.css`: `6cce301d037ab3483cda7a5d1587fcd6258e59e7baee4ed6d8b17fc080ac8620`

To rebuild, check out the pinned commit and apply `UPSTREAM.patch`,
`UPSTREAM.state.patch`, `UPSTREAM.view.patch`, then `UPSTREAM.frame.patch`. Remove
`public/models/` so Vite cannot copy the non-open mannequin, run `npm ci` from the
upstream lockfile, and run `npm run build`. Review the output, replace
`vendor/app.js`, and run `bun run build` in this package to produce the offline
Registry asset. Update every hash above only after reviewing both stages; toolchain
differences can change minified bytes even when behavior is unchanged.
